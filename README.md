# Andre's Prompt Engineering Collection

## About This Collection

This repository contains battle-tested prompts refined through real-world applications across business, technical, and creative domains. It is about the technique, not about having a huge collection. Each use case may not be entirely unique, but the purpose of this repository isn't to provide copy-paste solutions, it is to showcase the tricks and techniques that I use to make prompts effective.

I rely heavily on LLMs to refine my own prompts. As of the time of writing (July 2025), ChatGPT o3, Claude Opus 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro are excellent at helping craft better prompts.

Prompting is fundamentally about experimentation. Lots of it. I have countless examples where I have rewritten a prompt dozens of times before achieving the desired result.

Whether you are automating workflows, enhancing decision-making, or exploring AI capabilities, these prompts provide ready-to-use templates and demonstrate proven techniques. Browse through them, adapt them to your needs, and see immediate improvements in your AI interactions. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
