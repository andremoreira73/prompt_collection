# Andre's Prompt Engineering Collection

## About This Collection

This repository contains battle-tested prompts refined through real-world applications across business, technical, and creative domains. It about the technique, not about having a huge collection - each use case is, well, maybe not totally unique, but the point of creating a repo with examples is not for people to copy and paste, but to see some of the tricks that are used to make prompts work.

I use LLMs a lot to improve my prompts. As of the time of writing (July 2025), ChatGPT o3, Claude Opus 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro are excellent prompters.

In any case, whether you are automating workflows, enhancing decision-making, or exploring AI capabilities, these prompts provide ready-to-use templates and examples of tricks with proven effectiveness. Simply browse, adapt to your needs, and experience immediate improvements in your AI interactions. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
