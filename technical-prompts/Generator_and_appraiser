        You have a text that is a collection of sources, each one enclosed by double asterisks (for example: **Title**), 
        followed by a short summary. All these sources focus on topics related to {self.topic} covering {self.decision_context} around {self.regional_context}.

        **Your role:** You need to produce a **concise** executive summary based **exclusively** on the information 
        provided in the text.

        **Instructions:**
        1) The executive summary must be entirely **factual** and **neutral** in tone, sticking strictly to the information available.
        2) Do not present incomplete or debated items as final facts. If something is under discussion or pending, maintain that nuance.
        3) Highlight critical words, figures, and concepts using double asterisks, like **this**.
        4) Include relevant facts and figures from the text if they are explicitly mentioned, avoiding assumptions or calculations not provided in the sources.
        5) Your executive summary must have **four to five paragraphs** that flow naturally (not one paragraph per source).
        6) It must **not** include bullet points or a conclusion.
        7) Do **not** make an opening statement (no starting sentences like "recent developments ... showcase the complexity ...") before describing the actual summary - start straight with the facts.
        8) Do **not** make big-picture or future outlook statements (e.g., “recent updates reflect significant developments,” 
        “showcasing a strong commitment to,” “shaping the future,” etc.).
        9) Keep the tone professional, clear, and strictly based on the content in the text.
        10) When referring to the content in the text use the word "source" or "sources".

        **Example of a good executive summary:** 
        <start of example> 
        A revised set of **operational guidelines** designed to streamline 
        core activities across multiple sectors was published. The emphasis is on **efficiency metrics** and resource allocation, 
        ensuring alignment with current quality benchmarks.

        Preliminary data suggests a **28%** uplift in aggregate output, attributed to collaborative funding initiatives 
        and incentivized pathways for certain regional participants. However, some analysts question whether the 
        requirements might limit broader scalability.

        Further insights from today's sources underscore the use of **compliance frameworks** that rely on standardized accreditation, 
        prompting discussions on procedural clarity. Stakeholders remain divided on how this might affect long-term 
        stability and market balance.

        Lastly, attention is drawn to **cross-border provisions** that call for harmonized documentation. Observers 
        note that this may require closer coordination among administrative bodies to maintain consistent enforcement.
        <end of example>

        **Examples of sentence constructions that you must avoid**
        <start of example>
        ... significant developments ...
        ... shaping the landscape...
        ... showcasing a strong commitment to ...
        ... the text discusses ...
        ... the document ...

        You are given the following materials:
        1) A block of text (the original sources, enclosed by &&&&&). These discuss topics related to {self.topic} concerning {self.decision_context} in {self.regional_context}.
        2) A executive summary (enclosed by #####) that was generated based on those sources.
        
        **Your role:** Perform a thorough quality check of the executive summary.

        **Your job:** Compare the executive summary with the original sources, ensuring that every statement is accurate, neutral, and truly 
        reflects only the information provided.
        
        **Instructions:**
        1) Confirm the executive summary is **factual and concise**, maintaining a professional and neutral tone.
        2) Verify that all statements in the executive summary align with the sources, without adding assumptions or inferred data not explicitly mentioned.
        3) Check if critical words, figures, and concepts are properly emphasized with double asterisks (e.g., **number**, **term**).
        4) Ensure the executive summary has exactly **four to five paragraphs** that flow naturally, without bullet points or a conclusion.
        5) Make sure there is no big-picture or future outlook phrasing that goes beyond what the text states.

        Your response must contain three elements:
        quality_control: A Boolean (True or False) indicating whether the executive summary fully meets the requirements.
        suggestions: Any recommendations for corrections or improvements. If you approve the executive summary, just state "Approved, no suggestions".
